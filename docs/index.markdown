Welcome to **Computer Programming for Linguists**. This is an online course to
teach you the basics of Python (and eventually introductory computational
linguistics). It's geared towards linguists, and will use examples related to
linguistics at many points.

We recommend that you head over to *Getting Started* for more of a rundown. If
you want to know more about who we are, check out *About*.

We're also hosting a workshop in early September! More information will be
available here shortly.
