    "(TP 2, 2.1) One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to store and manipulate information in variables. A **variable** is a (unique) name that refers to a value. Think of a variable name as a label on a file drawer. You can change what's in the drawer, but the label on it will remain the same."
