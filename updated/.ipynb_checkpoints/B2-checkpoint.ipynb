    "# Block B, lesson 2: Conditional execution\n",
    "\n",
    "We now turn to conditional execution, the programming concept whereby we use the boolean values that we learned about in B1 to make the computer program do certain things and not others, i.e., to 'execute' conditionally on some boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning outcome:\n",
    "* you will be able to write conditional statements involving the `if`, `else`, and `elif` keywords.\n",
    "* you will be able to describe what a compound statement is, and what its components are (header, indented body)\n",
