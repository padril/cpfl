    "Let's say you have a dataset of vowel formants in Hz, and you've plotted them all nice, but the plot looks much different from the experiment you're trying to replicate. You look a bit closer, and it turns out the paper you're reading used the [Bark scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_scale)! To see if your results match, you'd now need to go and convert every Hz value by hand, and that would take you hours.\n",
