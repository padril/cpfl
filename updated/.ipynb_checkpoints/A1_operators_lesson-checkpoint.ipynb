    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first lesson. In this notebook, you will learn about:\n",
    "* what a computer program is (TP 1.1)\n",
    "* how to run **arithmetic statements** (TP 1.4)\n",
    "* how the **order of operations** works, both for arithmetic and non-aritmetic statements (TP 2.5)\n",
    "* what **values** are in Python, and which **data types** they belong to (TP 1.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acknowledgments\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks are inspired by (and sometimes outright quote from) the textbook _Think Python_. You can find the textbook in HTML, free of charge, here: [https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/). I will refer to the relevant sections of the textbook in the overview -- so TP 1.1 refers to section 1.1 of _Think Python_. While the textbook isn't necessary, it might be helpful for you to have a look at it, especially if you get stuck!\n",

    "### A note on practicing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook might form the lecture materials for a course in which it is used, or alternatively, if you're taking the module independently, you will be making your way through it by yourself. Regardless, in order to learn to program, practice is paramount! The exercises in the `exercises` folder that start with 'A1' are the ones that go with Block A, Lesson 1. For Block A, I'd recommend you take lessons 1 and 2 first before starting to practice (you will need the concepts from lesson 2 in order to practice with lesson 1)."

    "* **repetition**: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\n",

    "### 1.2.7 Errors\n",

    "Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax error**:\n",
    "“Syntax” refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is a syntax error.\n",
    "If there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python displays an error message and quits, and you will not be able to run the program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you might spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime error**:\n",
    "The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.\n",
    "Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic error**:\n",
    "The third type of error is “semantic”, which means related to meaning. If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run without generating error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.\n",
    "Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing."
