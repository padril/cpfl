# ### Question 1
# 
# What value will the following expression give?
# 
# ```Python
# 9%2
# ```
# 
# Create a code cell and assign the answer to a variable called `q1`

# ### Question 2
# 
# What value will the following expression give?
# 
# ```Python
# 9//2
# ````
# Create a code cell and assign the answer to a variable called `q2`

# ### Question 3
# What value will the following expression give?
# 
# ```Python
# 9.0%2
# ````
# 
# Create a code cell and assign the answer to a variable called `q3`

# ### Question 4
# 
# What value will the following expression give?
# 
# ```Python
# 9//-2
# ````
# Create a code cell and assign the answer to a variable called `q4`

# ### Question 5
# 
# If `x` has a negative value like the one below, what happens when we add x to another value?
# 
# ```python
# x = -17
# ````
# 
# What is the value of `5+x`?
# Create a code cell and assign the answer to a variable called `q5`

# ### Question 6
# 
# Suppose the cover price of a book is \\$24.95, but bookstores get a 40\% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
# 
# Create a code cell and assign the answer to a variable called `q6`

# ## Question 7
# 
# Use Python to calulate the area of a rectangle with length of 4 and width of 60. Store the output in a variable called `q7`

# ## Question 8
# 
# What do you expect to be the output of this calculation: 
# 
# ```python
# 10*10.0
# ```
# 
# Store your answer in a variable called q8

# ## Question 9
# 
# What is the output of this calculation?
# 
# ```python
# (10*3)%5
# ```
# 
# Store your answer in a variable called `q9`

# ## Question 10
# 
# What is the output of these calculations?
# 
# ```python
# 4.0%2
# ```
# 
# Store your answer in a variable called `q10`

# ## Question 11
# 
# What is the data type of the following value: `"Linguistics is cool"`  
# Please assign your answer as a String variable to `q11`.
# E.g. `q11 = "int"`
# 
# The possible answers are "str", "int", "bool", "float", and "NoneType".

# ## Question 12
# 
# What is the data type of the following value: `False`  
# Please assign your answer as a String variable to `q12`.
# 
# E.g. `q12 = "int"`
# 
# The possible answers are "str", "int", "bool", "float", and "NoneType".

# ## Question 13
# 
# Consider a variable that represents the total cost of a shopping trip in dollars and cents.
# 
# What type should its value be?
# 
# NOTE: Please assign your answer as a String variable to `q13`. 
# E.g. `q13 = "int"`
# 
# The possible answers are "str", "int", "bool", "float", and "NoneType".

# ## Question 14
# 
# Combine the integer `7`and the string `'years'` into a string `'7years'` stored in a variable called `q14`.

# ## Question 15
# 
# Convert the value in `number` into an integer and store it in a variable `integer`, then convert the value in `integer` into an integer and store it in a variable `q15`.
# 
# ```Python
# number = -4.3
# ```
