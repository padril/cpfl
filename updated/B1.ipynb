    "In the context of programming, a function is a **named sequence of statements that performs a computation**. When you define a function, you specify the name (as a header) and the sequence of statements (as the body). Later, you can **“call” the function by name**."

    "It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n",
    "* Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "* Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
    "* Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it."

The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and underscore are legal, but the first character can’t be a number. You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parentheses after the name indicate this function's **arguments**. In this case, three variables `price`, `n_people`, and `tip_percent` are created every time someone uses this function, with the values given **in order** by the user. You'll learn more about arguments in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
